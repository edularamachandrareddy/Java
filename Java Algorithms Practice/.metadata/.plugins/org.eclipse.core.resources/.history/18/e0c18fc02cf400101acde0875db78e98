 * (Sort points in a plane) Write a program that meets the following 
 * requirements:
 * 
 * Define a class named Point with two data fields x and y to represent a
 * point's x and y coordinates. Implement the Comparable interface for
 * comparing the points on x-coordinates and y-coordinates if x-coordinates are
 * identical.
 * 
 * Define a class named CompareY that implements Comparator<Point>. Implement the
 * compare method to compare tow points on their y-coordinates and on their
 * y-coordinates and on their x-coordinates if y-coordinates are identical.
 * 
 * Randomly create 100 points and apply the Arrays.sort method to display the
 * points in increasing order of their x-coordinates and in increasing order of
 * their y-coordinates, respectively.
